# Weather-forecast

# Introduction

A weather forecast website made purely with JavaScript, CSS, and HTML. The data is collected using an open-source API from weatherapi.com. The website can also be used on hand-held devices along with laptops and PCs, using the responsive layouts.

# Features

  1. The application displays:
      - Real-time temperature of a city.
      - Other types of information like humidity, AQI, visibility, sunrise-sunset time, and more.
      - Hourly forecast for the next 24 hours.
      - Weekly forecast for the next 7 days.
  
  2. The user can choose either their own location, or searching for a city from its name to be forecasted.
  3. The user can choose to have the temperature displayed in either Celcius or Fahrenheit.
  4. The user can also save multiple cities as favourites in the favourites list.

# Installations

To run this, a code editing environment is needed, which can run: 
- HTML5
- CSS
- JavaScript

Along with this, the code needs an API key from [weatherapi.com](https://www.weatherapi.com/my/), which can be taken for free after making an account and logging into the dashboard. The API key needs to be added in the JavaScript file `JavaScript\bar.js` at the beginning of the code, where it is mentioned in comments.


# Running the application

When the installations and API key extractions are ready. Simply run the HTML file `index.html`.

1. The welcome page will look something like this:

</br>
</br>
2. Simply choose your preferred temperature scale between °C and °F (optional, °C is the default scale), and then either click on 'Current location' or input your desired city name and click on 'Search'. This is what it will look like:
